== Description

This is a simple Angular App to follow
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/angular-basics[Treehouse Angular Basics Course].

I tried my best to describe everything I do in comments, and every step
in course I watch I try to find solutions for problems myself,
and then watch how Huston does it.

For now there is only one {app_js} with `MainController`.

There is only one {index_html} file and nothing else.

No package manager is used to properly use Angular, so
{angular_js} file is simply in {vendor}[vendor] directory.

This app at some point switched to 
https://github.com/nikiforov-alexander/rest-with-angular-following-course[My Spark/Angular repository].

There I connect simple CRUD operations to actual calls
to REST API service.
