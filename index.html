    <h1>My Tasks</h1>

        1. The ng-class directive applied 'editing-item' class
          to our "div" if, condition is true, i.e. when
          editing == true.
          This div class will be set to "edited", when
          "task.edited" is true, i.e. when we edited any of our
          tasks
        -->
        <div ng-repeat="task in tasks"

             By adding ng-model here, we can save in $scope
             variable "task", and use it later on.
             If we use "task.name", then we'll have "task"
             object with property "name".
             For now it seems that $scope.task.name is seen
             whereas not resolved by IDE

            label when "editing = false"

                   class="editing-label"

            1. input is shown when "editing = true"
            2. ng-blur sets editing to false, when
              we click somewhere outside input, and
              after that input becomes inactive, while
              label with ng-show becomes active
            3. "ng-change" will fire when input changes,
              setting "task.edited" to "true", so that
              we change our CSS class in "div" above
              and show "edited" near our Task.

                     function, that will be called upon click on this
                     anchor element. Another fun thing is that
                     you can probably put ng-click on any element, like
                     header for example ! and it will work
